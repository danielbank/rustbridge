# Let's make a Rust project!!

---
class: middle, left

## Project: Web Scraper

* Problem: there's data on a website that you want to use, but getting it out of the website would be tedious and error-prone.
* Examples:
  * "open" data that isn't in an easy-to-use format
  * Branding Brand
  * Vivisimo

---
class: middle, left

## Overview

* Request an Amazon wishlist-like page and extract titles and prices
* Use an HTTP client library (`hyper`) to make the requests
* Use an HTML DOM parser (`select`) to extract the data
* Process the data using Iterators
* [Code at various steps](https://github.com/rust-community/rustbridge/tree/master/workshops/web-scraper)

---
class: middle, left

## Start a new project

* Go to wherever you keep your code
* `cargo new --bin web_scraper`
* `cd web_scraper`
* `cargo run`
* It should say "Hello, world!"
* Use version control however you'd like

---
class: middle, left

# To crates.io!

???

* Show searching for http, which is horrible we're sorry, then sort by downloads
* Show the line to copy for the Cargo.toml

---
class: middle, left

## Adding the `hyper` crate

* Edit `Cargo.toml` file
* Beneath `[dependencies]` section add `hyper = "0.9.10"` so it looks like:

```toml
[package]
name = "web_scraper"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Carol (Nichols || Goulding) <carol.nichols@gmail.com>"]

[dependencies]
hyper = "0.9.10"
```

???

* A crate is a library that someone else made and shared, like rubygems
* Let's do `cargo run`!
* What else changed? Cargo.lock

---
class: middle, left

## How do we use `hyper`?

* To the docs!
* `cargo doc --open` will include hyper docs now!
* Let's go look!

???

* Click on "hyper" in the sidebar
* Click on "Client" since we want to use an HTTP client
* Check out the `GET` example! Go through each part

---
class: middle, left

## Using `hyper`

* Adding it to `Cargo.toml` just told cargo we wanted to have it available
* Have to bring the crate in with `extern crate`
* Going to bring `hyper::Client` into our scope for convenience
* At the top add:

```rust
extern crate hyper;
use hyper::Client;
```

---
class: middle, left

## Using `hyper`'s GET example

```rust
fn main() {
    let client = Client::new();

    let res = client.get("http://example.domain")
                    .send()
                    .expect("Request failed"); // <---- different

    assert_eq!(res.status, hyper::Ok);
    println!("{:#?}", response); // <---- different
}
```

???

* Creating a new hyper::Client instance
* Result of calling `get` method on client, passing the address as an arg
* Show clicking on `Client` to get docs for that struct
* `get` returns a request builder
* `send` does the request
* Returns a `Result<Response>`
* Examples tend to use `unwrap` because it's short, but we're going to change it to `expect`
* This example does a test, basically-- assert_eq! will panic if it fails
* Note that `hyper::Ok` is different than standard library `Ok`
* Talk about pretty debug output

---
class: middle, left

## Experiments!

* Let's run it with the clearly example address and see what happens!
* Let's run it with an address that will respond with a 404!
* Bonus challenge: take the URL as a command line argument!

---
class: middle, left

## How do we get the body of the `Response`?

* Look at the docs for the `hyper::Response` struct!

???

* Note the "and the response body via the `Read` trait."

---
class: middle, left

## Traits

* Guarantees that a type implements a set of methods
  * Compiler-checked duck-typing
  * `implements` interfaces in Java
* Can define default methods in terms of required methods
  * Sort of like Ruby enumerable/each
* Display and Debug are traits you've been using!

---
class: middle, left

```rust
extern crate hyper;

use hyper::Client;
use std::io::Read;

fn main() {
    let client = Client::new();
    let mut response =
        client.get("https://github.com")
              .send()
              .expect("Request failed");
    let mut body = String::new();
    response.read_to_string(&mut body).expect("Read failed");
    println!("{:?}", body);
}
```

???

* The trait needs to be in scope: `use std::io::Read;`
* `response` needs to be `mut` now
* Need a mutable string to read into
* Pass a mutable reference to that string to `read_to_string`
* Then we get the HTML of github.com!

---
class: middle, left

# WARNING!!

* Some webservers don't like it if you do a lot of requests quickly!

???

* Feel free to experiment, but don't run a script that makes thousands of requests per second
* All of vivisimo's office got blocked by google

---
class: middle, left

## Get the content we're going to parse

* Change the URL to `https://brson.github.io/demo/wishlist.html`
* Take a look in your browser, it's basically an Amazon wishlist page
* Ultimate goal: Titles and prices
* Web devs: inspect element!

---
class: middle, left

## Another crate: `select`!

* Add to your `Cargo.toml`: `select = "0.3.0"`
* Rebuild the docs: `cargo doc --open`

???

* Click select in the sidebar
* Click document, Document
* Scroll to `From &str`

---
class: middle, left

## Let's make a `Document` from our `String`!

* Have to make our `String` into a string slice first (sorry sorry)

```rust
use select::document::Document;

// ...

let document = Document::from(body.as_str());
println!("doc = {:#?}", document);
```

---
class: middle, left

## We have a Document, now what???

---
class: middle, left

## Let's `find` something!

* What's `Predicate`?
* Try using `find` to select something specific!
* Print with debug formatting to see what you get!

???

* Let everyone try for a bit
* Discuss variety of solutions

---
class: middle, left

```rust
use select::predicate::{Attr, Class};

// ...

let wrapper = document.find(Attr("id", "item-page-wrapper"));
let rows = wrapper.find(Class("a-fixed-right-grid"));
for row in rows.iter() {
    println!(" * Row {}", row.text());
}
```

---
class: middle, left

## Let's extract just the title and the price.

* Iterate through each row and get the title and price
* What about the "idea" row?

???

---
class: middle, left

## One way: using `match`

```rust
for row in rows.iter() {
    let title_node = row.find(Name("h5")).first();
    let price_node = row.find(Class("a-color-price")).first();
    match (title_node, price_node) {
        (Some(title), Some(price)) => {
            println!("* Book \"{}\", with price {}",
                title.text().trim(),
                price.text().trim()
            );
        },
        (_, _) => (),
    }
}
```

---
class: middle, left

## Another way: using `if let`

```rust
for row in rows.iter() {
    let title_node = row.find(Name("h5")).first();
    let price_node = row.find(Class("a-color-price")).first();
    if let (Some(title), Some(price)) = (title_node, price_node) {
        println!("* Book \"{}\", with price {}",
            title.text().trim(),
            price.text().trim()
        );
    }
}
```

## Bonuses

* Parse and sum the prices
* Extract more information
* Scrape data from a different page
* Scrape data from multiple pages in parallel and aggregate the results
